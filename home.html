		Welcome to my Ixalan financial review! Ixalan is the 76th set in Magic's 25 year history and was released on September 29th, 2017. The purpose of this site is to predict what cards in Ixalan are likely to rise and fall in price in 2018 and beyond, based on data from past, similar cards. I rated each rare and valuable uncommon and common on a scale from 1 to 10 in their current price, constructed playability, and casual playability to determine whether they will be smart to buy, keep, or sell in the future. I also plan to write articles about different aspects of M:tG finance and post them in the articles section here. If you're new to MAgic I'd recommend reading the introduction page before navigating the site further, as it gives some context to common phenomena in M:tG finance. The card directory has all the rares and chase uncommon and commons sorted by their tcgplayer.com median price as of 12/23/17. Each card's page has its price history data, the card's rating from 1 to 10, and cards comparable to it gameplay wise to compare its price and potential future trends to. The predictions page aggregates all my personal suggestions of cards to buy and sell, and a link to each of their pages. Thanks for visiting, and happy playing!
